	<div class="img_description">
	  <p>The SWIC AITP club offers workshops to introduce high school students to web students. I created this flier to hand out at one of our workshops. It includes a basic introduction to HTML and CSS, along with coding samples I put together to expand the project.</p>

	<div class="img_description">
	  <p>This poster was created as a project for my InDesign course. The prompt for the assignment was that I would be making a poster of something interesting, and it required 5 images, text wrap, and images with alpha masks.</p>
	  <p>For the design aspects of this project, I emphasized a bold color palette, and a font pairing that I felt was clean, but fun</p>

	<div class="img_description">
	  <p>This brochure was created for my InDesign Midterm. Our task was to create a brochure for a place one typically wouldn't take a vacation to. I was given a number of requirements, but the location, all of the design elements, and the content were left entirely up to me.</p>
	  <p>My design goal for this project was to create a clean composition, that uses a borderless style, a clear and consistent color palette, and has a pleasant flow to it.</p>

	  <p>SWIC AITP club is building a website for the Head 2 Hand Literary Magazine on campus. This is a concept logo I created for their brand, weaving two capital H together.</p>

	  <p>This logo revamp was relatively minor, but I aimed to clean up the old logo. Some areas I focused on were thinning the thick border, lining up the 'r' and the 'j', softening the sharp black, and giving it a little depth.</p>

	  <p>The SWIC AITP club reworked the St. Claire County <a href="http://stcchs.org/">Historical Society's Website</a>. As part of this project, our client had asked us to take their 200px image and enlarge it.</p>
	  <p>In addition to enlarging it, I designed this logo as a potential new logo, using themes I found while researching other historical society branding. In the end, the client found a higher resolution version of their logo, and turned down my pitch.</p>
